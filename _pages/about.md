I obtained my B.Tech. in Chemical Engineering from [Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee](https://www.iitr.ac.in/), India in 2011 and my Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering from [University of Minnesota](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/), USA in 2016 under the guidance of [Prof. Dr. Aditya Bhan](https://cse.umn.edu/cems/aditya-bhan). My PhD thesis was on "A Mechanistic Understanding of Light Olefins Selectivity in Methanol-to-Hydrocarbons Conversion on MFI". In 2017, I joined the research group of [Prof. Johannes A. Lercher](https://www.ch.tum.de/en/ch/faculty/staff/active-members/l/prof-dr-johannes-a-lercher/) at the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/en/) to focus on X-ray absorption and emission spectrosocpy and density functional theory calculations. Since 2021, I am a Group Leader at the [Chair II of Technical Chemistry](https://www.ch.nat.tum.de/tc2/home/) headed by Prof. Lercher at TU Munich and lead projects involving sulfur chemistry, electro- and photo-chemistry, and polymer upcycling using ionic liquids.

I am interested in combining kinetic and mechanistic studies with operando spectroscopic measurements and theoretical calculations to gain fundamental insights into industrially relevant catalytic systems.
