abstract = {Electrochemical methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) serves as a key route for renewable energy technologies. However, 
unmet challenges remain in the preparation of low-cost, efficient and robust electrocatalysts for MOR. Herein, a porphyrinic 
metal-organic framework (MOF) with spatially isolated Ni centres is prepared. Upon pyrolysis, this affords a single-atom Ni 
implanted nitrogen-doped porous carbon (20% Ni-N-C). Integrating abundant and accessible single-atom Ni sites, hierarchical porosity, 
excellent conductivity with stable Ni-N4 moieties all in one, the derived ultra-stable 20% Ni-N-C exhibits high MOR activity, 
impressive durability and CO tolerance, thereby outperforming state-of-the-art nonprecious metal based electrocatalysts. Computational 
insights reveal a low energy barrier of 1.19 eV for the rate-determining step, in agreement with the experimental observations of 
superior MOR activity. As the first foray into improving MOR efficiency with nonprecious metal based single-atom electrocatalysts, 
the yet-unrealized potential for MOFs and related modular hybrids is demonstrated.},

abstract = {A highly selective Ga-modified zeolite BEA for propane dehydrogenation has been synthesized by grafting Ga on 
Zn-BEA followed by removal of Zn in the presence of H<sub>2</sub>. A propene selectivity of 82% at 19% propane conversion illustrates 
the high selectivity at 813 K. The kinetic model of the catalyzed dehydrogenation including the elementary steps of propane adsorption, 
first and second C-H bond cleavage, and propene and H<sub>2</sub> desorption demonstrates that the propane dehydrogenation rate is determined 
by the first C-H bond cleavage at low p<sub>C₃H₈</sub>, while at high p<sub>C₃H₈</sub>, the rate is limited by the desorption of 
H<sub>2</sub>. The active sites have been identified as dehydrated and tetrahedrally coordinated Ga<sup>3+</sup> in the *BEA lattice. 
The low selectivity toward aromatics is concluded to be associated with the high Lewis acid strength of lattice Ga<sup>3+</sup> and 
the low Brønsted acid strength of the hydrated Ga sites.},

abstract = {NaY zeolite-encapsulated dimeric (Mo2S4) and tetrameric (Mo4S4) molybdenum sulfide clusters stabilize hydrogen as hydride binding to Mo atoms. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and adsorption measurements suggest that stabilization of hydrogen as sulfhydryl (SH) groups, as typical for layered MoS2, is thermodynamically disfavored. Competitive adsorption of H2 and ethene on Mo was probed by quantifying adsorbed CO on partly hydrogen and/or ethene covered samples with IR spectroscopy. During hydrogenation, experiment and theory suggest that Mo is covered predominately with ethene and sparsely with hydride. DFT calculations further predict that, under reaction conditions, each MoxSy cluster can activate only one H2, suggesting that the entire cluster (irrespective of its nuclearity) acts as one active site for hydrogenation. The nearly identical turnover frequencies (24.7 ± 3.3 molethane·h–1·molcluster–1), apparent activation energies (31–32 kJ·mol–1), and reaction orders (∼0.5 in ethene and ∼1.0 in H2) show that the active sites in both clusters are catalytically indistinguishable.},

abstract = {Cu-zeolites are able to directly convert methane to methanol via a three-step process using O2 as oxidant. Among the different zeolite topologies, Cu-exchanged mordenite (MOR) shows the highest methanol yields, attributed to a preferential formation of active Cu–oxo species in its 8-MR pores. The presence of extra-framework or partially detached Al species entrained in the micropores of MOR leads to the formation of nearly homotopic redox active Cu–Al–oxo nanoclusters with the ability to activate CH4. Studies of the activity of these sites together with characterization by 27Al NMR and IR spectroscopy leads to the conclusion that the active species are located in the 8-MR side pockets of MOR, and it consists of two Cu ions and one Al linked by O. This Cu–Al–oxo cluster shows an activity per Cu in methane oxidation significantly higher than of any previously reported active Cu–oxo species. In order to determine unambiguously the structure of the active Cu–Al–oxo cluster, we combine experimental XANES of Cu K- and L-edges, Cu K-edge HERFD-XANES, and Cu K-edge EXAFS with TDDFT and AIMD-assisted simulations. Our results provide evidence of a [Cu2AlO3]2+ cluster exchanged on MOR Al pairs that is able to oxidize up to two methane molecules per cluster at ambient pressure.},

Here, we show an unprecedented methanol yield per Cu of 0.6, with a 90–95 \% selectivity, on a MOR solely containing [Cu3(μ-O)3]2+ active sites. DFT calculations, spectroscopic characterization and kinetic analysis show that increasing the chemical potential of methane enables the utilization of two μ-oxo bridge oxygen out of the three available in the tricopper-oxo cluster structure. Methanol and methoxy groups are stabilized in parallel, leading to methanol desorption in the presence of water.},

abstract  = {Photochemical and electrochemical reactions are highly relevant processes for (i) transforming chemicals (e.g. photoreduction of isopropanol to acetone{,} electrochemical hydrogenation of benzaldehyde to benzyl alcohol{,} etc.){,} and (ii) sustainable energy production (e.g. photoreduction of CO2 to methanol{,} electrocatalytic H2 evolution reaction). It is therefore of importance to monitor the structural changes and to understand the properties of active sites under photocatalytic and electrocatalytic reaction conditions. Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) provides the means to investigate the nature of active sites under realistic reaction conditions. In this contribution{,} we describe the successful development of photochemical and electrochemical cells for operando XAS measurements during photocatalytic and electrocatalytic reactions. We have used the operando photochemical cell to monitor the formation of Pt nanoparticles on graphitic carbon nitride nanosheets (g-C3N4-ns) via photodeposition under visible light illumination and observed the formation of highly dispersed Pt nanoparticles with an estimated size of ∼2.5 nm and >60% dispersion. We have also tested this cell to follow the oxidation state of Pt in Pt/TiO2 and Pt/g-C3N4-ns during H2 evolution reaction (HER). We observed that Pt predominantly existed as metallic (reduced) Pt0 species under HER conditions{,} and that PtOx species were partially reduced from PtIV to Pt0 upon illumination with UV or visible light. The rates of H2 evolution obtained in the photochemical cell (12.1 mmol g−1 h−1 on Pt/TiO2 and 1.01 mmol g−1 h−1 on Pt/g-C3N4-ns) were comparable to that obtained in a standard top-irradiated photoreactor (16.6 mmol g−1 h−1 on Pt/TiO2 and 1.76 mmol g−1 h−1 on Pt/g-C3N4-ns). The operando electrochemical cell was successfully tested to monitor the changes in the structure and oxidation state of Pd in Pd/C electrocatalyst during electrocatalytic hydrogenation (ECH) of benzaldehyde. It was demonstrated that Pd in Pd/C was present in a partially reduced state (∼80% Pd0 and ∼20% PdII) and Pd nanoparticles did not degrade upon the application of an external potential under ECH reaction conditions.},

Ethene selectivity increases monotonically with increasing aluminum content for HZSM-5 samples with nearly identical crystallite size consequent to an increase in the intracrystalline contact time analogous to our recent report detailing the effects of crystallite size (Khare et al., 2015) on MTH selectivity. The confected effects of crystallite size and site density on MTH selectivity can therefore, be correlated using a descriptor that represents the average number of acid sites that an olefin-precursor will interact with before elution.},

abstract = {Cofeeding acetaldehyde (1–4 C\%) with dimethyl ether (DME) and methanol (DME:methanol ∼9:1, on a carbon basis) on two MFI-type zeolites: a conventional (Conv) MFI zeolite (SiO2/Al2O3 ∼80, diffusion length ∼250 nm) and a self-pillared pentasil (SPP) MFI zeolite (SiO2/Al2O3 ∼150, diffusion length ∼1.5 nm) at 673 K resulted in a monotonic increase in selectivity toward ethene (from 9.3 to 15 C\% on Conv MFI and from 1.4 to 6.4 C\% on SPP MFI) and methylbenzenes (from 4.9 to 7.8 C\% on Conv MFI and 2.6 to 5.3 C\% on SPP MFI). The mechanistic basis for this increase in ethene and methylbenzene (MB) selectivity is acetaldehyde undergoing multiple aldol-condensation reactions to form higher homologues (e.g., sorbaldehyde) that subsequently undergo ring-closure followed by dehydration to form aromatics (e.g., benzene). Cofeeding acetaldehyde, therefore, increases the concentration of aromatics inside the zeolite pores, which in turn enhances the propagation of the aromatics-based methylation/dealkylation cycle and consequentially results in higher ethene production. In an isotopic experiment where 13C2-acetaldehyde (∼4 C\%) was coreacted with unlabeled DME and methanol (DME:methanol ∼9:1, on carbon basis) on Conv MFI and SPP MFI at 673 K, ethene present in the effluent was enriched with two 13C labels and the net 13C-content in ethene (11–12\% on Conv MFI and 45–52\% on SPP MFI) was higher than the 13C-content in MBs (5–6\% on Conv MFI and 9–17\% on SPP MFI). Ethene, therefore, besides being formed via aromatic-dealkylation, is also being produced from acetaldehyde or its aldol-condensation products via a direct synthesis route.},

abstract = {Self-pillared pentasil MFI (∼1nm diffusion length) exhibited low ethene selectivity (1.1%) at <100% conversion for the catalytic reaction of dimethyl ether (DME) at 723K and ∼60kPa DME pressure suggesting that the aromatics-based catalytic cycle is intrinsically suppressed in the pores of MFI under these reaction conditions. Co-feeding toluene or p-xylene with DME increased the number of chain carriers of the aromatics-based cycle, thereby enhancing its propagation and resulting in a 2–3-fold increase in ethene selectivity. Co-feeding propene or 1-hexene, however, did not have an effect on the product distribution, suggesting that the olefins-based hydrocarbon pool is saturated in the pores of MFI. At high temperature (723K) and low DME space velocity (⩽2.5molC[molAl-s]−1), conditions resulting in complete DME/methanol conversion, the catalyst bed comprises two stages: The first stage performs methanol-to-hydrocarbons chemistry in the presence of DME/methanol; the second stage begins after 100% DME conversion is achieved and is characterized by the absence of DME/methanol. The aromatics-based methylation/cracking cycle is absent in the second stage as methylbenzenes cannot dealkylate in the absence of DME/methanol, and the dominant pathway to ethene formation under these reaction conditions is olefin inter-conversion.},

abstract = {Light olefin selectivity in methanol-to-hydrocarbons conversion on MFI increases with an increase in crystallite size because intra-crystalline residence time of methylbenzenes increases as a consequence of increased transport restrictions, which enables these methylbenzenes to undergo multiple methylation/dealkylation reactions before exiting the crystal. Selectivity toward light olefins, for the reaction of dimethyl ether (DME) at 623K, increased monotonically from 22% in 2nm-MFI (∼2nm crystallites) to 47% in 17μm-MFI (∼17μm crystallites) at 46–59% net DME conversion. Transport restrictions were introduced externally in a conventional MFI sample (500nm-MFI) by single-/multi-cycle silylation using tetraethyl orthosilicate. Light olefin selectivity, for the reaction of DME at 623K and at 46–59% net DME conversion, increased from 33% in the conventional MFI sample to 49% in a sample that had undergone three silylation treatments. Adsorption uptake measurements of 2,2-dimethylbutane were used to estimate the “effective” crystallite size of the silylated MFI samples. Total light olefin selectivity and ethene/(2-methyl-2-butene+2-methylbutane) increased monotonically with the effective crystallite size for all zeolite samples used in this study, irrespective of their provenance, thereby suggesting that the mechanistic basis for increase in light olefin selectivity with increasing crystallite size is the enhanced propagation of aromatics-based catalytic cycle.},

abstract = {The observed product distribution in methanol-to-hydrocarbons (MTH) catalysis can be rationalized based on the relative rates of propagation of the aromatic- and olefin-based cycles that operate on the zeolite catalyst. We report that the ratio of ethene to 2-methylbutane+2-methyl-2-butene (ethene/2MB) yield can be used to describe the propagation of aromatic and olefin methylation/cracking cycles. The co-reaction of 12C-ethene with 13C-dimethyl ether (DME) shows that the rate of DME conversion (1.62molC (molAls)−1) is ∼20 times faster than ethene conversion (0.08molC (molAls)−1), suggesting that ethene can be considered as terminal product for MTH at 623K. At iso-conversion conditions at 548K, propene is co-fed with DME to increase propagation of the olefin-based cycle and correspondingly a 1.7-fold decrease in the ethene/2MB yield is observed. Similarly, the co-reaction of toluene with DME increases propagation of the aromatic-based cycle and a 2.1-fold increase in the ethene/2MB yield is observed. The ethene/2MB yield also increased by a factor of 2 as DME conversion increased from 5% to 62%, which is consistent with the observed concurrent increase in selectivity to ethene and methylbenzenes. For the reaction of DME alone, increasing the temperature from 548K to 723K increases the propagation of the olefin-based cycle and a corresponding decrease in the ethene/2MB yield from 4.7 to 1.3 is also observed. The ethene/2MB yield varies systematically with feed composition, conversion, and temperature, showing that this ratio describes the relative propagation of the aromatic to olefin methylation/cracking cycles in MTH conversion on H-ZSM-5.},
